        <div class="wraping-text">Spring 2023, I took Aero 494 or Make to Innovate. This is an aerospace project based
          class where I joined a team of other engineers from a variety of majors to continue work on a project.
          I joined the team FlyHy, a newly formed team with the goal of powering a model air craft with a hydrogen 
          fuel cell. I was the only person on the team with any electronics experience which I had from solar car
          so I was assigned the role of doing PCB design. Throughout the semester I learned KiCad for PCB design and
          created a power monitoring system that could monitor the output power of the system and log it for future
          analysis. I wrote code for the project in C++ for the Arduino Nano that runs the code. After I got the board ordered,
          I created a first draft of a power regulating system that would be more compatible for power the electrical 
          system of the model aircraft. This ended up being an interesting and challenging project. This was the first
          team I was a part of where I was the sole knowledgeable member in electrical design. This became
          a challenge as I was trying to get important information for my design such as current draw or specifics for ordering parts. The board had a few errors on it but I was able to fix them and get it working as intended.
