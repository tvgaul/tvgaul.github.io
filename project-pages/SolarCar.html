        <div class="body-text">At the beginning of my freshman year at Iowa State University (ISU), I joined PrISUm, the Solar Car team at ISU. I quickly got involved in working on the car. The club aims to build a working car powered by the sun that can race against other solar cars in races during the summer and inspire others interested in science, technology, engineering and math (stem), and clean energy. As a part of an extensive team, I joined the electrical subteam and projects within that subteam.

          <div class="body-text">As a part of the electrical sub-team, I worked on the circuit board, and some programming of HAL the horn and lights board in the car. Working on Hal, I became more familiar with embedded systems coding C, Altium Designing (an industry-standard software for PCB design), and CAN (Controller Area Network, a communication protocol that allows the different parts of the car to communicate). After I finished board design, I got the experience of testing the board with electrical lab equipment and creating new revisions from the testing experience.

      <p>As the year progressed and the car neared completion, I started helping with the system integration testing. We had each portion of the car working independently, but we ran into many problems and bugs as we put them all together. This gave me a great deal of experience debugging the issues and learning different problem isolation and solving methods. This was valuable knowledge because these things can occur when working on engineering projects for companies. 
      </p>
      <p>I was a part of the race crew that attended the competition and qualified for the car during the summer. We had to fix issues with qualifications and other things that came up while preparing for the actual event or something that broke during the event. This was a very time-constrained high-stress event for the entire team, which is similar to what can occur in the industry and was a significant learning experience problem solving under pressure.  
      </p>
      <p>The following year Fall 2021 and Spring of 2022, I started my role as assistant Electrical Director running meetings, assisting the overall organization of the Electrical team, and helping out when necessary on work and testing days. That Summer, we went on race again with greater success and became the first Multiple occupant vehicles of Iowa State to Qualify for the American Solar Challenge. 
      </p>
      <p>From starting Fall of 2022 to Summer 2023, I was been Electrical Director leading the electrical sub-team by selecting our project focus and management team for the year. I lead workdays and onboarding new members to ensure future teams.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, being a part of the solar car team has taught me many technical, engineering, and teamwork-based skills. The solar car team consists of people majors from software engineering to business, and we all have to work together to get a car working and running; outside of school, companies have to run the same way. This team allows me to work together to achieve a common goal.
