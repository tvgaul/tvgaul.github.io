        <div class="wraping-text"> Winter 2022, I had an Co-Op in La Motte, Iowa and had my first apartment. I did not have a 
          dining table and just used a folding table. I started designing a real table to replace the folding table. This was
          the first project that I came up with a full design ahead of time. I used Solidworks to design the table. Unfortunately,
          I did not get the table completed during my Co-Op, but had it prepared for my next apartment. A change that we had not
          planned on was an additional cut into the beams going between the legs. This was due to needing more space between the legs
          of someone in a chair and the horizontal beams. I then went on to design matching
          benches to go with the table initially with the design in Autodesk. For both projects, we used alder which made caused some
          challenges with alder tends to not be very straight wood. Additionally, it has a lot of knots in the wood which we filled with epoxy.
          The table and benches were also designed to be taken apart to make it easier for moving with how much apartment changing I deal 
          with while in college. This table and benches are very solid, preformed great, and turned out beautifully.
