            pens. Eventually we got a lathe that we assembled out of two partial lathes. Then finally January 2023
            we got the rest of tools to start making pens. Since then we have tried many pen kit designs and wood
            types. </div>

                The pen used a slimline pen design. The pen turned faster than I expected and turned out way better
                than I expected for my first attempt.

                exchange. It was very popular and went to my cousin who is a lawyer and he uses them from his clients to sign items.

                      had not previously seen or heard of mango in woodworking. It turned nicely and I tried a Concava pen kit for with it.
