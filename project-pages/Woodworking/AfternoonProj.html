              <span class="wrapping-text"> My grandpa came up with a design for card holders. These card holders are useful for 
                playing card games that hands can get very large. They are also useful for card games with kids that can struggle
                with hands of cards. I made a set of card holders for the local middle school's special education classroom after
                working there over a break and seeing students struggle with holding cards.

              <span class="wrapping-text">The cube in a cube was a really quick project that was mentioned in a woodworking book
                that I have. It can stump people holding it as they try to figure out how to remove the inner cube from the outer
                cube. The secret is that it is impossible. The inner cube is manufactured within the inner cube by drilling holes 
                in from the six sides and then cutting through the remaining corners to loosen the inner cube. This is probably my
                favorite project that can be done in a hour or two.

              <span class="wrapping-text">When I took shop class in middle school we had the project of making a log clock. I took that 
                project and repeated it a log from a lake that is very meaningful to my mom's side of the family. What is more the log
                came from a tree that had a tree house a bunch of my family members grew up playing on. A bunch of my relatives had me 
                make more clocks with some of the remaining wood.

              <span class="wrapping-text">With some scrape cedar we had from refurbishing my great grandma's cedar chest I made a 
                picture frame for my girlfriend. I saw the marbling of the sapwood and heartwood of the cedar and knew I had to do 
                something with it. It just so happened that the grain in the corners lined up pretty nicely too. The picture frame turned out gorgeous and I really like how the epoxy fill on the corner of the 
                frame looks.I am very happy with how the frame turned out and that I could make use of some beautiful scrape wood.

                which I made for him. This was earlier into my time in the shop and was of the first projects I did completely independently.

              <span class="wrapping-text">In addition to the log clock project I did in middle school was making a clipboard.
                After making the clipboard in class I wanted to make more as a gift to some of my teachers. In the following years 
                I have made dozens of these clipboards. They make a great gift and I enjoy how they display a variety of woods and how 
                it really highlights the wood making them up. These are just some of the clipboards I have made. I have made clipboards 
                of just about any of the hard woods we make use of in our workshop.
