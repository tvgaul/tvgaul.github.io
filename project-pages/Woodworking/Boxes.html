          design for a jewelry box and I made a variety of them with different woods
          and modified the design for some of the projects.

              <span class="wrapping-text">This was the first box I worked on made out of oak
                with Walnut in the corners. The Harry Potter logo was wood burned in with 
                Ammonium Chloride solution and a heat gun. The box was a gift for a friend who 
                is a big Harry Potter friend.

                It was a similar design to the Harry Potter box with purpleheart wood instead of walnut 
                in the corner keys.

                designs and was made out of cedar. It was my first project using cedar and the wood 
                turned out beautifully.

              <span class="wrapping-text">Summer of 2020, I made as surprise gift to a high school friend when
                she went off to college. The box is made with sandwich of oak and mahogany. She attended 
                Iowa the big rival school to Iowa State, so put a Iowa State logo on the inside had all the 
                people from our home town that were attending Iowa State sign the box. It was a very good surprise
                to her, especially in the rather lonely school year caused by Covid.
