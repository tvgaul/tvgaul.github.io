          focus on the smaller details with the boxes and focus on maximizing the effect of the 
          wood grain.

              <span class="wrapping-text">After my grandparents passed away my mom and my
                older brother made roserys with beads made with flowers from their funeral. We 
                wanted to make boxes to hold the rosarys to give to members of my dad's side of the family.
                My grandfather who passed away is who we go all the woodworking equipment from initially and 
                who taught my dad the woodworking skills he passed along to me so it was a very meaningful
                project to me. The rosary boxes were made from a wide variety of woods such as walnut,
                leopard wood, mahogany, cherry, maple, and oak. To build the rosary boxes I used a bunch of
                hole saws, forsener bits, and a bunch of sanding to get the round shapes.

                to protect a deck of cards in a backpack. I gave this card box and deck to a friend

                and also to try making something out of alder. I also demonstrated it for a talent
                show because my skillset are not great for a performance. I put a windmill on top because
                they are an icon at my hometown.

                oboe reeds so I came up with this design which could hold up to 20 oboe reeds and made
                it out of mahogany. This was also the first project where I tried using small hinges.

                  but I hung onto it and eventually repurposed it to be a box for a gift to my girlfriend
                  I matches a larger box I gave to her prior to us dating. The lighter wod is oak and the 
                  center wood is mahogany. I designed and 3d printed the velvet covered holer for the necklace itself.
