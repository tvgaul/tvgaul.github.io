        <div class="body-text"> Batteryless sensor nodes are an emerging technology that enables low-cost, low-maintenance, 
          and long-lifetime embedded sensing. Rather than being wired into a continuous power supply or provisioned with a battery, 
          these sensor nodes survive solely on harvesting energy from ambient sources available in their environment, such as RF 
          signals, solar, vibrational, or thermal. As such, they are a challenge to design since these sources are often 
          highly variable and very low power. Our team was tasked with creating a testbed for researchers to use for 
          the battery-less nodes they are developing.

        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">My team had the task of developing a testbed system for testing multiple batteryless sensor nodes
            communicating with each other. The goal of our project was to develop both hardware and software to test these nodes. Additionally,
            we had the task of making a cleaner batterless sensor node hardware or "BOB" node setup of multiple boards that make it a clean stack. Our system was
            then connected to this BOB node and monitored aspects of it; wired data such as up time due to the Bob nodes not being on all the time. It
            also monitored the wireless communication between the BOB nodes. All this data was sent from the monitor to a central computer
            or host to organize the data and made it accessible for researchers. By the end of the year we had a system for ten of these BOB
            and monitoring board pairs. We sucessfully did a 3 node setup in a network configuration demostrating scalability.
             The design was scalable beyond this though, with the ability to be applied to a design with hundreds of 
            nodes.   
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Within this project I had two tasks. I was elected group leader, so I organized the work effort,
            organized our timeline, managed communication with our client, managed our documentation, and handled submissions for class. Outside
            of the leadership tasks, I was a member of our software team writing the embedded code that ran on the microcontrollers
            to monitor the test and communicates. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Throughout the project, I grew in my embedded systems skills as I read through
            preexisting code, read documentation, design system archtecture, and wrote code. With that work I developed skills with proposing
            ideas and describing concerns I see. Additionally, I developed skills within leadership
            specifically leading a small technical group, keeping meetings on topic, and creating agendas. I also gained skills with figuring
            out a clients requirements and preferences when developing a solution for them.

        <h1>Definitions</h1>
<li><b>BOB node-</b> sensor node that are batteryless (powered solely by energy harvesting) that wirelessly communicate with other BOB nodes.​</li>
<li><b>Sniffer node-</b> independent node assigned to each BOB node with the purpose of configuring, emulating sensed events, and  monitoring the BOB nodes on times and communication. They communicate with each other wireless to aggregate data.​</li>
<li><b>Sink sniffer node-</b> Destination sniffer node that aggregates data from all sniffer nodes and saves it to a host.​</li>
<li><b>Host-</b> Central logging system that gets data from the sink sniffer node and allows researchers to easily view and manipulate data. </li>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<li>Have 5 to 10 sniffer, BOB pairs fully constructed by the end of year.​</li>
<li>Scalability in design in Sniffer code and communication and hardware for BOB and Sniffer (1 sniffer per BOB).​</li>
<li>Mechanical durability of BOB and Sniffer interface and stand-alone unit for testing use​.</li>

<li>Have a Central node system that organizes files from sniffers.​</li>
<li>Sniffers only cause trivial effect on BOB's performance. (Sniffers electrically isolated from each other)​</li>
<li>Sniffer to Sniffer communication does not interfere with BOB communication.​</li>
<li>Sniffers record both wireless data and wired which could be disconnected.​</li>

    <div class="body-text"> Our Design is described in our design document below. Our project had complications of multiple PCB
      designs with RF components and a network for many codes aggregating data on multiple RF bands. We had a microcontroller on each 
      band for each node comunicating over SPI. We ran into many challenges as we developed the project.
