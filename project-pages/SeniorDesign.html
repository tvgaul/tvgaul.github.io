        <div class="wraping-text"> Batteryless sensor nodes are an emerging technology that enables low-cost, low-maintenance, and long-lifetime embedded sensing. Rather than being wired into a continuous power supply or provisioned with a battery, these sensor nodes survive solely on harvesting energy from ambient sources available in their environment, such as RF signals, solar, vibrational, or thermal. As such they are a challenge to design since these sources are often highly variable and very low power. Our team has been tasked with creating a testbed for researchers to use for the battery-less nodes they are developing.

          <div class="body-text">My team has the task of developing a testbed system for testing multiple of the batteryless sensor nodes
            communicating with each other. The goal of our project is to develop both hardware and software to test these nodes. Additionally
            we have the task of making a cleaner sensor or "BOB" node setup of multiple boards that make it up in a clean stack. Our system must
            then connect to this BOB node and monitor aspects of it wired such as up time due to the battery nodes not being on all the time. It
            will also monitor the wireless communication between the BOB nodes. All this data will be sent from the monitor to a central computer
            or host to organize the data and make it accessible for researchers. By the end of the year we have the goal of having ten of these BOB
            and monitoring board pairs. The design should be scalable beyond this though with the ability to be applied to a design with hundreds of 
            nodes.   
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Within this project I have two tasks. I have been elected group leaders so I organize the work effort,
            organize our timeline, manage communication with our client, manage our documentation, and handle submissions for class. Outside
            of leadership task I am also a member of our software team writing the embedded code that will run non each of these test designs 
            to monitor the test and communicate back. 
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">Throughout the first month of this project I have grown in my embedded systems skills as I have looked through
            preexisting code, reading documentation, and writing my first pieces of code. With this work I have developed skills with proposing
            ideas and describing concerns I see as I understand the project well. Additionally, I have developed skills within leadership
            specifically leading a small technical group keeping meetings on topic and creating agendas. I have also gained skills with figuring
            out a clients requirements and preferences when developing a solution for them.

        <h1>Definitions</h1>
<li><b>BOB node-</b> sensor node that are batteryless (powered solely by energy harvesting) that wirelessly communicate with other BOB nodes.​</li>
<li><b>Sniffer node-</b> independent node assigned to each BOB node with the purpose of configuring, emulating sensed events, and  monitoring the BOB nodes on times and communication. They communicate with each other wireless to aggregate data.​</li>
<li><b>Sink sniffer node-</b> Destination sniffer node that aggregates data from all sniffer nodes and saves it to a host.​</li>
<li><b>Host-</b> Central logging system that gets data from the sink sniffer node and allows researchers to easily view and manipulate data. </li>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<li>Have 5 to 10 sniffer, BOB pairs fully constructed by the end of year.​</li>
<li>Scalability in design in Sniffer code and communication and hardware for BOB and Sniffer (1 sniffer per BOB).​</li>
<li>Mechanical durability of BOB and Sniffer interface and stand-alone unit for testing use​.</li>
<li>Sniffers communicate with each other to pass and compare data from BOB.​</li>
<li>Central node that cannot lose power and that can be selected from any sniffer recording data taken by sniffers. ​</li>
<li>Have a Central node system that organizes files from sniffers.​</li>
<li>Sniffers only cause trivial effect on BOB's performance. (Sniffers electrically isolated from each other)​</li>
<li>Sniffer to Sniffer communication does not interfere with BOB communication.​</li>
<li>Sniffers record both wireless data and wired which could be disconnected.​</li>
<li>Include spare GPIO ports on the sniffer hardware for future debug. ​</li>
<li>Configurable to access unused function on BOB and sniffer.​</li>
<li>10 Dollars or less per sniffer node.​</li>
<li>Week of continuous power for operation of Sniffer​.</li>
<li>Implement a system that is easy to move for testing. ​</li>
<li>Do not require modification of BOB code for Sniffer implementation. ​</li>
<li>Implement hardware for wireless mass reprogramming of BOB.​</li>
<li>Thorough documentation on the project. </li>
