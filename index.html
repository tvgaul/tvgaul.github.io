        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I was raised in Pella, Iowa, and graduated from Pella Community High School in 2020. Growing up I enjoyed building Legos, playing soccer, running, woodworking, playing saxophone in band, and computers. 
            Those experiances led me to choose to study computer engineering at Iowa State University. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Throughout my time at Iowa State, I have been active with the Solar Car Club, Prisum, exposing me to electrical hardware design, electrical system debugging, project management, embedded systems, and team leadership. During my work experiances, I learned about electrical harness design, electrical manufacturing, testing, and firmware through an internship at Weiler and two with IBM, and a Co-Op at Collins Aerospace. </div>

              <div class="body-text project-card-text">Batteryless sensor nodes are an emerging technology that enables low-cost, low-maintenance, and long-lifetime embedded sensing. Rather than being wired into a continuous power supply or provisioned with a battery, these sensor nodes survive solely on harvesting energy from ambient sources available in their environment, such as RF signals, solar, vibrational, or thermal. As such they are a challenge to design since these sources are often highly variable and very low power. Our team has been tasked with creating a testbed for researchers to use for the battery-less nodes they are developing. </div>
