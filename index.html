              <div class="body-text project-card-text">Batteryless sensor nodes are an emerging technology that enables low-cost, low-maintenance, and long-lifetime embedded sensing. Rather than being wired into a continuous power supply or provisioned with a battery, these sensor nodes survive solely on harvesting energy from ambient sources available in their environment, such as RF signals, solar, vibrational, or thermal. As such they are a challenge to design since these sources are often highly variable and very low power. Our team has been tasked with creating a testbed for researchers to use for the battery-less nodes they are developing. </div>
